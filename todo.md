# Todo

## Nixos
- Install on desktop

- Fix red screen when waking from sleep
Seems to occur after suspend when closing lid, possibly also after idle
External display does not matter
Woke from idle successfully at least once
Got 3 in a row when closing lid
Can suspend from wlogout menu just fine


## Nvim
- migrate to nixvim
- migrate to lazy nvim
- try out some note taking plugin

## Hyprland
- fix hyprpaper shutting down
- fix red screen appearing, probably when waking from suspend?
