# Todo

## Nixos
- Install on desktop

- Fix red screen when waking from sleep
Seems to occur after hibernate when closing lid, possibly also after idle
External display does not matter


## Nvim
- migrate to nixvim
- migrate to lazy nvim
- try out some note taking plugin

## Hyprland
- fix hyprpaper shutting down
- fix red screen appearing, probably when waking from suspend?
